#problem.py - module that implements the Problem class. 
#Every problem has a unique id that does not change. A problem can be part of 
#multiple topics. Mastery level tells how 
#well the user has mastered the problem and influences how frequently the 
#question is asked from the user. Ratings keep track of right(1) and wrong(0) answers
#answer history keeps track of answers and the time of an answer. Time from last
#correct answer is also followed. Prominance is priority value for the problem, 
#that influences how likely the problem will be presented to the user.
